        <h2>Montreal Then and Now</h2>
        <p>Montreal Then and Now is a personal project that began when I discovered a Montreal Gazette photographer and journalist named Bryan Demchinsky. He published a book in 1985 called Montreal Then and Now/ Hier et aujourd'hui where photos of the city as it was in the 80s were compared to the same location as it was 100 or more years back.</p>
