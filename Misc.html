        <p class ="labdesc">Montreal Then and Now is a personal project that began when I discovered a Montreal Gazette photographer and journalist named Bryan Demchinsky. He published a book in 1985 called Montreal Then and Now/ Hier et Aujourd'hui where photos of the city as it was in the 80s were compared to the same location as it was 100 or more years back.</p>
        <p class = "labdesc"> I took the locations from the book and visited them in March/ April 2021 to retake the photos and use them for an interactive web map. This personal project is very much a work in progress and is not associated with the original author of the book. Click any of the images to open the map and explore the rough draft!</p>
