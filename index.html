        <p class="labdesc">Supervised by Prof. Jeannine St-Jacques, I had the opportunity to collect pollen samples at Mount Orford (Orford Quebec). I held this position concurrently with my other research position at Bishop's University. While at CHAPEL I worked on a number of environmental proxies used to investigate paleoenvironments, though I primarily focused on pollen and seed analysis.<a class="labwork" href="https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/geography-planning-environment/research/labs/chapel.html" target = "_blank"> For more informaiton on CHAPEL click here</a></p>

        <p class="labdesc">Supervised by Prof. Matthew Peros, I worked on a paleoenvironmental reconstruction using pollen and seeds taken from a sediment core. The core was taken from a subaquatic karst cave named Cueva Margarita where the remains of a giant sloth and a extinct arboreal sloth were found. Based on the presence of the sloth remains, the seeds, and the results of environmental reconstrution it was concluded that the sloths were likely in search of food and then were trapped in the cave. The project was in part funded by the National Geographic:<a class="labwork" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Azj0bHXQcY" target = "_blank"> To watch the diving team collect the bones click here</a></p>
        <!-- project two-->
        <h4 class ="projects">Las Llandas</h4>
        <p class="labdesc">This work was a continuation of my previous research for PerosLab. We wanted to see if recovered coprolites from the same species of ground sloth discovered in Cueva Margarita would show evidence of the types of plants the species ate, as well as do an environmental reconstruction based on the pollen, seeds, or plant macrofossils found. The coprolites sampled are believed to be dated to the holocene-pleistocene boundary (around 10 000 BP).</p>
